<h1>Rules</h1>

<p class="bottom_padding">If you're attending any one of my raids, you're expected to be familiar with these rules. I no longer post them on the individual raids because it's just a wall of text that a lot of people don't read anyway and it's harder to update that way. That being said, if anyone fails to read these the consequences are on them as they are available for anyone who cares enough to look.</p>

<p class="section_header">Ventrilo</p>
<div class="section">
	<p>Vent is required for current level content, no exceptions. If I deem it necessary I may require it during FL or DS.</p>
</div>

<p class="section_header">Roster</p>
<div class="section">
	<ul class="less_indent">
		<li>I invite returning people right away and generally on a first come first serve basis when I have over 10 returning. Exceptions *may* be granted for people getting legendaries and for people who are there EVERY week and just happened to sign up a little late.</li>
		<li>For raids that get a lot of new people signing up, I will set reserves about a day before the raid so I have time to look at everyone and not end up with 20 people on reserves for a 10 man raid.</li>
		<li>If you've never attended my raids before you should be willing to be a reserve. I usually do have a spot or two for new people but otherwise the raids can be a pretty tight roster.</li>
		<li>I don't invite new people on a first come first serve basis and frankly I don't have a magic formula. Depends on what we need for the composition, your experience, your gear, ratings, attendance, attitude (or perceived attitude through feedback on your page) and the raid you've signed up for (because sometimes bringing less experienced/geared people is ok but others it's not).</li>
		<li>If you're not approved or even set as a reserve and you're still interested, communication goes a long way. You can message me or if I state I will be there, join me in the chat room 5 minutes before raid time in case I need to fill in no shows after reserves.</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<p class="section_header">Adding Me</p>
<div class="section">
	<p>I have my battle tag information posted in the voicechat information section of OpenRaid for approved players (which includes reserves) as well as here on this website. That being said, if you're not actually approved on the roster, do not send me a friends request. If you're a reserve and I need you I'll send you a request. 95% of the time I'll ignore it unless I actually do need a reserve and you've already sent me a request... but seriously, don't. It's annoying.</p>
	Also, if you do add me, be sure to tell me who you are and what raid you signed up for.
	<p>Finally... if you're late for a raid or weren't online as a reserve and you get your request later... don't accept it. Just decline it... because you know you're not going to talk to me anyway and I'll just remove you when I notice you and don't know who you are. Now... if you think you're going to talk to me, then hey you can keep me on and actually say something to me. That's all cool. And you know if you're late and want to apologize or try to clear up confusion, that's cool, you can accept and talk to me about it. But seriously, I don't like logging on two days later to see some random person on my list and not know who they are.</p>
</div>

<p class="section_header">Loot</p>
<div class="section">
	<ul class="less_indent">
		<li>I will not take gear reserves... at all. Only reserves are legendaries.</li>
		<li>If you're on a wait list for legendary items you are expected to continue showing up. If you rarely show up, you will either be removed or pushed down from/on the wait list.</li>
		<li>Loot will be on group loot except for bosses that drop mounts. It's the group's responsibility not to ninja legendary items. <b>Anyone who ninjas anything will be removed immediately.</b></li>
		<li>Any loot that is not won with a bonus roll can be needed on.</li>
		<li>To need on a pattern you have to have the profession on the toon you bring to the raid. Link is required.</li>
		<li>Mounts are free roll with bonus rolls and as such will be master looted.</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<p class="section_header">Bonus Rolls</p>
<div class="section">
	<ul class="less_indent">
		<li>You'll receive 5 points for each raid you attend (cap at 100).</li>
		<li>You have a one week grace period to miss a raid before you start losing points.</li>
		<li>After your grace period you'll lost 5 points a week until you hit 0.</li>
		<li>You can spend your bonus roll on mounts OR gear (yes, gear even though I don't do reserves).</li>
		<li>You must state whether or not you want to spend your bonus roll before rolling on an item.</li>
		<li>If someone uses their bonus on gear, it will not be master looted. If someone else wins a roll but doesn't pass if the person won with their bonus, that person will be removed for ninjaing.</li>
		<li>Your bonus roll will work by taking your roll and adding your bonus to it.</li>
		<li>If you choose to use your bonus roll but still lose, you do not lose any points.</li>
		<li>If you win an item with your bonus roll your bonus roll will be reset (to 5 since you're counting the current week of attendance).</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<p class="section_header">Behavior</p>
<div class="section">
	<ul class="less_indent">
		<li>Trolling, spamming, rage quitting, ninja-logging and anything else of the sort will not be tolerated and you will be subject to the loss of your bonus roll (or at the very least not receive a bonus for that week) and chances are you won't be brought back.</li>
		<li>While my raids are marked as mature, I still expect people to treat each other with respect.</li>
		<li>When I'm doing invites I expect you to switch to the toon you're bringing and be ready for the invite. I typically do invites as early as 5 minutes before the raid and will start looking for reserves at raid time if you're not here with no word as to what's going on.</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<p class="section_header">Current Level Raids</p>
<div class="section">
	<ul class="less_indent">
		<li>Current level raids should be treated as progression groups (whether they're as smooth as a farm or actually progression). You need to be appropriately geared, gemmed, enchanted and reforged. No PvP gear.</li>
		<li>If you have any suggestions you can talk to me in whispers and if I decline your suggestion, I expect you to respect that decision and keep it to yourself. If you keep whining about something or try to force it yourself, you may be removed and downrated. If the content we are doing is new to me, I'm pretty open to suggestions since all I have is my research to base it off, so that shouldn't be an issue there. Otherwise, the strategies I present are ones I've been using with my guild and as such if people do what they're told, they will work. If people do everything right and they don't work that's where suggestions are open.</li>
		<li>When we haven't quite got a raid on farm I expect people to know when it's acceptable to joke around and troll each other (because I know my raiders love to do that) and when to be serious and get things done. If we're finishing trash and coming up to a boss, general chatter in vent needs to stop so I can talk about the fight or if I'm trying to talk about a fight during trash to save time, people need to hush. During a fight there should be minimal chitchat so that we can communicate clearly about the fight.</li>
	</ul>
