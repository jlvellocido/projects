         <p>Oreo was born in <time datetime="04-15-2016">April 2016</time> outside of a farm house in Bennett, Iowa and adopted at 2 months old. He, like the rest of his siblings, had an upper respiratory and eye infection. Although he was fortunate enough to be rescued, all of his siblings died.</p>

         <p>Oreo is a mischievous cat who loves to do whatever he pleases. From jumping on computers to crawling between blinds, nothing stops this little devil! Despite his inability to behave, he is the sweetest cat you'll ever meet. He loves everyone and tolerates, sometimes even enjoys, being held.</p>

         <p>You can find him snoozing on any bed, chair, box, or surface in sight... including your laundry basket filled with clean clothes! He'll be sure to wake you up either by lovingly kneading your neck or smothering your face with his entire body.</p>
